# merac-o-matic
merac-o-matic is a script which automatically shills Windows so you don't have to.

Telling potential converts about Windows is hard work. You have to repeat a few tired arguments over and over, cite one data point from a statistics website to say that you're "backing up your claims", the lot. Luckily, these sorts of posts are extremely formulaic, and, thanks to this script, they can now be produced automatically. Ironically, this program is free software licensed under the GPL.
